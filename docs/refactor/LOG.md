# Module-structure refactor log

The plan, the rules every session follows, and a copyable prompt per chunk are in the runbook:
https://claude.ai/artifact/4ZapAQXgsVu96YRkToSJFS (read it with the Artifact tool).

This file is the hand-off between sessions. Read it before starting a chunk; add an entry
(newest at the bottom) when you finish one.

## How to run the checks

From the repo root:

```sh
node scripts/check-precache.mjs              # sw.js PRECACHE_ASSETS vs. what the pages load
cd tests && npm install && npm run check     # precache check + Playwright smoke + screenshots
```

- `npm test` (in `tests/`) runs Playwright only. `npm run check` runs everything.
- Unit tests (`node --test`, chunk 0B) are not wired into `npm run check` yet. 0B should
  add them.
- Chromium is preinstalled in Claude Code cloud sessions (`/opt/pw-browsers`). Don't run
  `playwright install` there.

### Accepting an intended visual change

Chunks that only move code must leave every screenshot identical. If a chunk is *meant* to
change how something looks: `cd tests && npm run test:update`, then check the changed PNGs
in `git diff --stat tests/baselines` and mention them in your entry below.

Baselines are per platform (`tests/baselines/linux/...`). Google Fonts is blocked in tests, so
text uses fallback fonts, which differ between OSes. A macOS run won't find baselines and will
write its own under `baselines/darwin/`. Don't commit those unless you mean to keep both.

## How the tests work

- `tests/serve.mjs` serves the repo root with real 404s. Playwright starts it on port 4173.
- `tests/helpers.mjs` intercepts every request that leaves localhost:
  - PapaParse comes from `tests/node_modules`, pinned to the same 5.4.1 the pages use.
  - Sleeper API calls are answered from `tests/fixtures/sleeper/*.json`. These are generated
    by `node tests/fixtures/sleeper/make-fixtures.mjs`, which describes a 2-team "Fixture
    League" for user `mds_test`, 2026 week 2. Edit the generator, not the JSON.
  - A Sleeper URL with no fixture gets a 404 and is recorded in `unmocked`. The MLS sync
    test asserts that list is empty, so a new endpoint fails loudly. Add a route in
    `SLEEPER_FIXTURES` and a file in the generator.
  - Everything else (Google Fonts, MathJax, Ko-fi, LeagueLogs, Google Sheets, headshot
    images) is aborted.
  - The clock is fixed at 2026-09-15T16:00Z.
- A test fails on any uncaught exception, any `console.error`, any local HTTP status 400 or
  higher, or the fatal boot banner (`#mds-boot-error`). `openApp()` checks this right after
  load, so a broken import reports the missing file (for example `HTTP 404: /lineup/dbx.js`).
- Seeded states: `seedMds()` pastes `fixtures/rankings.csv` (24 players) and makes 5 picks.
  `seedMls()` syncs the fixture league by league ID.
- Tabs are opened with `window.showTab(id)` (MDS/MLS) or `window.switchTab(id)` (T-Score).
  These are the same functions the nav buttons call. One test also clicks a real bottom-nav
  button.
- Coverage: 14 smoke tests and 10 screenshot tests (40 PNGs) across desktop (1280×900) and
  phone (390×844). The MLS matchup simulator runs in its Web Worker in the smoke test, but its
  output isn't screenshotted because it's random.

### Known gaps (good follow-ups, not blockers)

- MLS has no ranking set loaded in the seeded state, so rank-dependent UI (power rankings,
  scout results, "Unranked" badges replaced by ranks) is only covered in its empty form.
  Chunks 3C–3E would benefit from seeding an MLS rankings upload first.
- No test covers backup/restore. Chunk 1B's card asks for a round-trip check.
- `tests/`, `scripts/` and `docs/` are served publicly by Cloudflare Pages, because the site
  deploys the repo root with no build output directory. This is harmless (about 9 MB of
  baselines). To exclude them, point Pages at an output directory, which needs a build step.

## Entries

### 0A — Smoke tests, screenshot baselines, precache checker

- Added `tests/` (Playwright 1.56.1 in its own `package.json`, so the repo root still has
  none and Cloudflare Pages behaves exactly as before), `scripts/check-precache.mjs`, and
  this log.
- `check-precache` fails on: a precached path missing on disk, a script/stylesheet/import/
  `new Worker()` target that a precached page loads but isn't precached, and a precached
  JS/CSS file that nothing loads. I verified it by breaking `sw.js` on purpose, then restored it.
- Housekeeping: removed the duplicated README intro and updated its project structure.
  `.vscode/settings.json` stays tracked; the rest of `.vscode/` is now ignored. The old
  `.gitignore` ignored the whole folder even though one file was tracked.
- No app code changed.
- Observed, not changed: with the fixture league synced, the Scout tab still shows the "Sleeper
  Sync Required" banner. This may be a real quirk or caused by the fixture data (for example
  the "Sync Sleeper Waivers & Trades" step was never run). Check before treating it as a bug.
  The DEF fixture shows an "R" rookie badge because the fixture gives it `years_exp: 0`.
- Next: 0B (unit tests), then 1A.

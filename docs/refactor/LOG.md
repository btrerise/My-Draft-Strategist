# Module-structure refactor log

The plan, the rules every session follows, and a copyable prompt per chunk are in the runbook:
https://claude.ai/artifact/4ZapAQXgsVu96YRkToSJFS (read it with the Artifact tool).

This file is the hand-off between sessions. Read it before starting a chunk; add an entry
(newest at the bottom) when you finish one.

## How to run the checks

From the repo root:

```sh
node scripts/check-precache.mjs              # sw.js PRECACHE_ASSETS vs. what the pages load
node --test                                  # unit tests in tests/unit/ (Node 22+)
cd tests && npm install && npm run check     # precache + unit tests + Playwright smoke + screenshots
```

- `npm test` (in `tests/`) runs Playwright only. `npm run unit` runs only the unit tests.
  `npm run check` runs everything.
- Run `node --test` with no arguments, from the repo root or from `tests/`. Node 22 or newer
  is needed: the tests import the app's `.js` ES modules directly, and the repo root has no
  package.json, so Node has to detect module syntax on its own. `node --test tests/unit/`
  doesn't work, because Node 22 treats a directory argument as a file. To run one suite:
  `node --test tests/unit/rankingsParser.test.mjs`.
- Chromium is preinstalled in Claude Code cloud sessions (`/opt/pw-browsers`). Don't run
  `playwright install` there.

### Accepting an intended visual change

Chunks that only move code must leave every screenshot identical. If a chunk is *meant* to
change how something looks: `cd tests && npm run test:update`, then check the changed PNGs
in `git diff --stat tests/baselines` and mention them in your entry below.

Baselines are per platform (`tests/baselines/linux/...`). Google Fonts is blocked in tests, so
text uses fallback fonts, which differ between OSes. A macOS run won't find baselines and will
write its own under `baselines/darwin/`. Don't commit those unless you mean to keep both.

## How the tests work

- `tests/serve.mjs` serves the repo root with real 404s. Playwright starts it on port 4173.
- `tests/helpers.mjs` intercepts every request that leaves localhost:
  - PapaParse comes from `tests/node_modules`, pinned to the same 5.4.1 the pages use.
  - Sleeper API calls are answered from `tests/fixtures/sleeper/*.json`. These are generated
    by `node tests/fixtures/sleeper/make-fixtures.mjs`, which describes a 2-team "Fixture
    League" for user `mds_test`, 2026 week 2. Edit the generator, not the JSON.
  - A Sleeper URL with no fixture gets a 404 and is recorded in `unmocked`. The MLS sync
    test asserts that list is empty, so a new endpoint fails loudly. Add a route in
    `SLEEPER_FIXTURES` and a file in the generator.
  - Everything else (Google Fonts, MathJax, Ko-fi, LeagueLogs, Google Sheets, headshot
    images) is aborted.
  - The clock is fixed at 2026-09-15T16:00Z.
- A test fails on any uncaught exception, any `console.error`, any local HTTP status 400 or
  higher, or the fatal boot banner (`#mds-boot-error`). `openApp()` checks this right after
  load, so a broken import reports the missing file (for example `HTTP 404: /lineup/dbx.js`).
- Seeded states: `seedMds()` pastes `fixtures/rankings.csv` (24 players) and makes 5 picks.
  `seedMls()` syncs the fixture league by league ID.
- Tabs are opened with `window.showTab(id)` (MDS/MLS) or `window.switchTab(id)` (T-Score).
  These are the same functions the nav buttons call. One test also clicks a real bottom-nav
  button.
- Coverage: 14 smoke tests and 10 screenshot tests (40 PNGs) across desktop (1280×900) and
  phone (390×844). The MLS matchup simulator runs in its Web Worker in the smoke test, but its
  output isn't screenshotted because it's random.

### Known gaps (good follow-ups, not blockers)

- MLS has no ranking set loaded in the seeded state, so rank-dependent UI (power rankings,
  scout results, "Unranked" badges replaced by ranks) is only covered in its empty form.
  Chunks 3C–3E would benefit from seeding an MLS rankings upload first.
- No test covers backup/restore. Chunk 1B's card asks for a round-trip check.
- `tests/`, `scripts/` and `docs/` are served publicly by Cloudflare Pages, because the site
  deploys the repo root with no build output directory. This is harmless (about 9 MB of
  baselines). To exclude them, point Pages at an output directory, which needs a build step.

## Entries

### 0A — Smoke tests, screenshot baselines, precache checker

- Added `tests/` (Playwright 1.56.1 in its own `package.json`, so the repo root still has
  none and Cloudflare Pages behaves exactly as before), `scripts/check-precache.mjs`, and
  this log.
- `check-precache` fails on: a precached path missing on disk, a script/stylesheet/import/
  `new Worker()` target that a precached page loads but isn't precached, and a precached
  JS/CSS file that nothing loads. I verified it by breaking `sw.js` on purpose, then restored it.
- Housekeeping: removed the duplicated README intro and updated its project structure.
  `.vscode/settings.json` stays tracked; the rest of `.vscode/` is now ignored. The old
  `.gitignore` ignored the whole folder even though one file was tracked.
- No app code changed.
- Observed, not changed: with the fixture league synced, the Scout tab still shows the "Sleeper
  Sync Required" banner. This may be a real quirk or caused by the fixture data (for example
  the "Sync Sleeper Waivers & Trades" step was never run). Check before treating it as a bug.
  The DEF fixture shows an "R" rookie badge because the fixture gives it `years_exp: 0`.
- Next: 0B (unit tests), then 1A.

### 0B — Characterization unit tests for the pure modules

**No app files changed.** Also wired the unit tests into the existing checks: `npm run check`
in `tests/` now runs `node --test` between check-precache and Playwright, `npm run unit` runs
them alone, and the README's check list includes `node --test`. Playwright's
`testMatch: /.*\.spec\.mjs$/` doesn't match `*.test.mjs`, so the two runners don't overlap.

Added:

| File | Covers |
|---|---|
| `tests/unit/statsEngine.test.mjs` | `lineup/statsEngine.js`: every export, all four boom/bust tiers, threshold boundaries, the fallback CV, `actualScore` short-circuit |
| `tests/unit/waiverScanner.test.mjs` | `lineup/waiverScanner.js`: rank-display re-derivation, scan ordering, free-agent filtering, `fillLineup` slotting rules, every `checkAgainstLineup` status |
| `tests/unit/rankingsParser.test.mjs` | `lineup/rankingsParser.js`: vertical, headerless, per-position and horizontal layouts; title lines; odd headers (padded, upper-case, FantasyPros `RK`/`TIERS`/`PLAYER NAME`); SoS; every diagnostic reason; xlsx notes tabs; failure paths |
| `tests/unit/names.test.mjs` | `normalizeName` / `isNameMatch` from `js/utils.js`, including every `NAME_ALIASES` pair (it fails if an alias is added without a test row) |
| `tests/unit/helpers/loadUtils.mjs` | Runs `js/utils.js` in a `node:vm` context with a permissive DOM stub, and returns `normalizeName`, `isNameMatch`, `findCsvQuoteProblem`, `NAME_ALIASES` |
| `tests/unit/helpers/parserEnv.mjs` | Stand-ins for `window`, `Papa`, `XLSX` and `FileReader`, which the parser reads as globals |

I checked the suites by mutating a scratch copy of the modules. Changing a boom comparison to
`>=`, letting SoS keep decimals, changing `MAX_TITLE_ROWS`, editing an alias, changing
`FALLBACK_CV` and swapping FLEX/SFLEX in `SLOT_ORDER` each made at least one test fail.

#### Conventions

- Unit tests go in `tests/unit/*.test.mjs` and helpers in `tests/unit/helpers/`. Helper names
  don't match Node's default test globs, so they aren't run as tests. `*.spec.mjs` (Playwright)
  doesn't match those globs either.
- Each suite imports its module by relative path in one place, near the top. After a move,
  only that import line changes.
- Tests that pin odd behavior are named `CURRENT BEHAVIOR: ...`. A deliberate fix updates the
  test and says so here. A pure move must leave them passing.
- The Papa stub is not PapaParse. It splits simple unquoted CSV the way Papa does with
  `header: false, skipEmptyLines: true`, and it throws on quoted input. When a test needs
  Papa output that plain splitting can't produce, such as quote errors, it passes
  `papaResult` verbatim. Real Papa parses File input asynchronously, but the stub is
  synchronous, so multi-file batches always finish in upload order in these tests.

#### When later chunks move these modules

- **1A** (utils.js split): point `UTILS_PATH` in `helpers/loadUtils.mjs` at whatever still
  defines these as plain-script globals. If `normalizeName`/`isNameMatch` become an ES module
  (`js/shared/names.js`), import them directly in `names.test.mjs` instead.
  `NAME_ALIASES` needs to stay reachable for the coverage check: export it, or read it the
  way the helper does now. `parserEnv.mjs` also takes `findCsvQuoteProblem` from that helper.
- **1B**: `rankingsParser.js` → `js/shared/rankings/parse.js`. Update the import in
  `rankingsParser.test.mjs`. If `parse.js` imports `normalizeName` instead of reading
  `window.normalizeName`, the `window.normalizeName` stub in `parserEnv.mjs` is no longer
  used but does no harm.
- **2C**: add MDS's title-line inputs to `rankingsParser.test.mjs` before merging
  `findHeaderRowIndex`/`stripTitleLines` in.
- **3C**: update the `waiverScanner.js` import. **3F**: update the `statsEngine.js` import.

#### Behavior that looked wrong (tested as-is, not fixed)

1. **Boom/bust thresholds are strict** (`statsEngine.js`). The comment describes boom as
   "20+ points from a WR", but the empirical count uses `> boomThreshold`. Exactly 20 (WR/RB),
   24 (QB) or 15 (TE) is not a boom. Exactly at the bust line is not a bust either (`<`).
2. **Pos Rank cells like `WR2` are ignored** (`rankingsParser.js`). An explicit Pos Rank
   column is read with `parseInt`, so the common `WR2`/`RB14` format gives NaN. The row then
   falls back to the overall rank, as if the column weren't there. Only bare numbers work.
3. **SoS values keep only their digits** (`rankingsParser.js`). The value goes through
   `.replace(/[^0-9]/g, '')`, so `4.5` becomes `"45"` and `-2` becomes `"2"`. Values are
   stored as strings.
4. **FantasyPros headers are only partly recognized** (`rankingsParser.js`). `RK` is in
   `KNOWN_NON_NAME_HEADERS` but isn't used as a rank column, and `TIERS` isn't `tier`. Rank
   then comes from row order, which is right only when the file is sorted, and tiers are
   dropped. `SOS SEASON` isn't read as SoS.
5. **Position-named name headers depend on upload mode** (`rankingsParser.js`).
   `VALID_NAME_HEADERS` includes `quarterback`, `running back` and `flex` for per-position
   lists. In a single-file upload, those headers switch on the horizontal layout, which finds
   no `... player` column and reports `no-name-column`. `Wide Receiver`, `Tight End`,
   `Kicker` and `Defense` work in both modes.
6. **Horizontal sheets: FLEX overwrites rank and tier** (`rankingsParser.js`). The FLEX
   column sets `rank` and `tier`. Current exports have no `FLEX Tier` column, so any player
   listed under FLEX loses the tier from their position section (it becomes `null`). QBs
   (and K/DEF) get `rank` equal to their positional rank. waiverScanner's comments already
   account for that, so it may be intended, but it's recorded here.
7. **Name suffix stripping has no word boundary** (`js/utils.js`). The regex
   `(jr|sr|iii|ii|iv|v)$` runs after spaces are removed, so any surname ending in those
   letters is cut: `Ivanov` becomes `ivano`. Two different players could collide.
8. **`isNameMatch` matches two names that both normalize to `""`** (`js/utils.js`). The
   falsy check runs on the raw inputs, so `isNameMatch('Jr.', '123')` is `true`.
9. **`fillLineup` ignores slot types it doesn't know** (`waiverScanner.js`). Slots outside
   `SLOT_ORDER` (for example IDP `DL`, or `BN`) are dropped from `starters` without a
   warning. mls.js builds its slot requirements from the app's own types (REC_FLEX and
   WRRB_FLEX count as FLEX, SUPER_FLEX as SFLEX; see `autoReqs` in mls.js), and the scanner
   passes `st.slot.replace(/[0-9]/g, '')`, so this probably can't happen today. I only
   grepped this and didn't trace it fully. If an unknown slot did get through,
   `checkAgainstLineup` could name that slot's player as "displaced".

#### Checks run

`node scripts/check-precache.mjs` OK. `node --test` 117/117 from both the repo root and
`tests/`. `cd tests && npm run check` passes: 24 Playwright tests, screenshots unchanged.

#### Not done / for later chunks

- No `CACHE_NAME` bump and no `sw.js` change: the only new files are tests and docs, which
  aren't served or precached.
- The parser's xlsx path uses an `XLSX` stub, not real SheetJS. Real-file fidelity, such as
  how SheetJS writes dates or merged cells to CSV, isn't covered.
- The unit tests use a Papa stub so that `node --test` needs no `npm install`. 0A installs the
  real `papaparse` 5.4.1 in `tests/node_modules`. A later chunk could run the parser
  fixtures through it as well, which would cover quoting and tokenization. That would make
  those tests depend on the install.
- 0A and 0B share the branch `perf/render-storage-pass`: 0B was rebased onto 0A's commit
  there, so merging that branch merges both chunks.
- Next: 1A. It must update `tests/unit/helpers/loadUtils.mjs` (see above).
